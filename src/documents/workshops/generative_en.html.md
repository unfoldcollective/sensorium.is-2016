#####The workshop will be facilitated by Karsten Schmidt, an award-winning computational artist and designer. During one day, participants will co-create a modular sculpture using custom software, digital fabrication and simple electronics. The workshop is suitable for beginners as well as more experienced designers or artists, interested in exploring the boundaries of their creativity.#####

This workshop builds on Karsten's processes and tools from his <a href="http://thi.ng/" target="_blank">thi.ng project</a>. Participants will be working with geometry, a variety of materials, fabrication techniques, laser cutter and custom developed software. The workshop will provide an hands-on overview and skills in tools, techniques and the landscape of computational design practices. Participants will learn how to employ techniques of parametric and generative design as well as digital fabrication tools/equipment and handle the physical assembly of the sculpture. There will also be some basic work with code, but no prior coding skills are required.

The workshop will take place in LAB - a new space for digital fabrication in the center of Bratislava.
