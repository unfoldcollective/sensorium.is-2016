<p class="intro">Domestic Data Streamers is a team of developers that has taken on the challenge of transforming raw data into interactive systems and experiences. We spoke with Pau Garcia, one of the members on the team about how they got started, what inspires them and how they represent data in physical experiences.</p>

## How did you get started with DDS?

Two years ago I was invited to paint a graffiti mural for a street art festival in Barcelona. With some friends(Joan Planas, Dani Pearson and Alexandra de Requesens) we started thinking about not doing an illustration or graffiti artwork but something that could be more connected with the people of the square were the venue was going to happen, so we decided to create an interactive mural that was drawn by the information of the people passing by the wall.

## Why do you make things physical?

Almost the 99.9999% of the information we manage today has been born in a total digital environment, we think, communicate and understand in digital format. Our question is if this digital format lets us understand what is the more human reality behind data, numbers or the most basic information.

## What inspires you the most and why did you choose to work with data?

Probably contemporary arts are the best place to find new forms of inspiration, it's easy to see how artists work with metaphors and still you are able to make your own interpretation of them. We didn't decide to work with data, when approaching the concept of data we understand it as just a language to talk about our own reality. It can talk about your family, your sleep habits or even the stock markets.


## What was the most challenging project for you so far and why?

We worked in a project for one of the biggest companies of chemistry in Europe, it was challenging to understand how arts, science, sociology and design can work in the environment of a big corporation. Still knowing that we were born in an environment of public and mostly cultural sector we really think it's important to imagine the future that works like the ones we do can have a bigger impact in all the different levels of our society from an NGO to a big corporation.

## Your projects often invite participants to co-create the installation, how does that work?

East meets West is an installation that evolves with peopleâ€™s answers, unveiling social patterns with the information given by the participants. They are asked to answer different questions by knitting the information on the different options, generating a visualization of collective thoughts and facts.

East meets West was developed during the DeTour Program at the PMQ, a place for international creative happenings hosting the Business Of Design Week in Hong Kong. The main objective was to unveil the differences regarding the ways of thinking, creating, understanding and acting of different cultures.


## What will you be talking about at Sensorium?

We will talk about the origins of Domestic Data, the philosophy that is behind the shift that we are experiencing and some cases of work that we have done and that we have been able to find in our own life.
