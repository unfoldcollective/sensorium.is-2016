Besides exciting foreign guests we will also showcase  artworks of young Slovak artists working with new media. You can look forward to experiencing dynamic installations as well as meeting their creators who can answer all your questions.

## **Turbines** - Jonathan Ravasz

Wind turbines strongly interfere with our environment. These un-comprising structures create utopian sceneries. Their motion inadvertently generates choreographies across the landscape. In his project Jonathan is exploring these accidental choreographies by “artificially” recreating this phenomenon.

## **BAEND** - Zuzana Liptáková

Next generation of music merchandise.
Music is gradually becoming more and more detached from its original physical carrier. But the carrier’s purpose was not only distribution but it also had a marketing and a collecting value. These dimensions are purely depend on the physical object and disappear in the virtual world. How will the marketing and collecting of music look like in the century to come? In my work I try to find answers to this question.

## **The resting place** - Miriam Rut Elijaš

The project focuses on creation of space where the spectator percieves sound visually in such a natural way as if he was listening to it. Light objects are therefore not pillows, neither lamps but they integrate with the viewer into the environent and become part of it. Each object reacts to sound by its light intensity.
